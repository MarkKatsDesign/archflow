Realtime API models (text, audio, image) have separate per‑token pricing. Image generation uses GPT‑image models with token-based billing and approximate per‑image costs ranging from a few cents depending on quality. Sora video models are billed per second of generated video. Fine‑tuning uses per‑token training rates for GPT‑4.1 model variants or hourly pricing for reinforcement fine‑tuning. Built‑in tools such as Code Interpreter, File Search, and Web Search have additional per‑session, per‑GB‑day, or per‑1K‑call charges. Token rates and available models change frequently; refer to the pricing page for current details.",
